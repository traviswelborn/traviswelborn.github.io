### Arlington Humane Society

One of my graduating term projects was to redesign the <a href="http://arlingtonhumanesociety.org" title="Arlington Humane Society">Arlington Humane Society</a>  website and branding. Our task was to create a new experience that would encourage adoptions, class attendance and donations to the society.

The following photos were used in the redesign:

### USA National Homebuyers

Featuring a simple layout, this college freelance project served as a landing page for a startup flipping houses. The owner worked with fellow businessmen across the country and focused on a country-wide scale. The landing page explained the necessary steps of their buying process and included a form, validated using jQuery, for direct contact.

The following photos were used in the design:

### Mansfield, Texas: We&rsquo;ve Got Game

My first project with the City of Mansfield was to create a website around their tourism brand &ldquo;Mansfield&rsquo;s Got Game&rdquo;.
